the app have four screens or pages only:

1. Sign in Screen

  <img title="The Sign in screen" alt="Sign in screen" src="./screenshots/signin_screen.png" width="60%" style="text-align: center;">
</p>

2. Register/Sign up Screen

<p align="center">
  <img title="The Sign up screen" alt="Sign up screen" src="./screenshots/register_screen.png" width="60%">
</p>

3. Home Screen (only show the user to chat to)

<p align="center">

## How to run this project in your computer?

### 1. install and setup firebase

Here is some command to install Firebase CLI on Windows and Linux (I don't have a macbook yet)
- Install Firebase CLI Tools on Windows with winget
```
winget install -e --id Google.FirebaseCLI
```

- Install Firebase CLI Tools from npm (Node Package Manager) on Linux. You will need to install npm first.
```
npm install firebase-tools
```

Then login to your firebase account
```
firebase login
```
Note: make sure that firebase is in your path and restart your terminal.

Then you need to create a firebase project, setup the authentication and firestore. The video tutorial show you how to do it.
